class: center middle inverse

# Practical reasons

---

# Frequentist LMER can lead to anti-conservative *p*-values


---

# BRMs always converge, while LMERs don't always do

---

# LMERs require as much work as BRMs

---

# You can embed prior knowledge in BRMs while you can't in LMERs

---

# Bayesian inference is more intuitive than frequentist inference




---

class: center middle inverse

# Conceptual reasons

---

# LMERs only provide evidence for rejecting the Null Hypothesis

---

# A frequentist CI is not what most people think it is

---

# With BRMs you can compare any hypothesis, not just null/alternative

---

# LMER is based on an imaginary set of experiments

---

# BRMs will converge towards the true value in the long run
